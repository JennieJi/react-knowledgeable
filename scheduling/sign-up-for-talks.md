# Sign Up for Talks

Please add your topic in the table below. Once scheduled, we'll move your row to the agenda.

For video options, please indicate one of the following:

- :see_no_evil: **no video**: Do not videotape at all. I sweat knowing there's a camera
- 🐒 **video but do not publish to public channels**: I want to use the video for my own improvement on public speaking
- 🦍 **ok to publish**: Of course if you feel your talk don't turn out well as expected we can alwasy revoke this. But otherwise Let's do this :)

**Ready-by Date** is the date you will have the talk ready. We will try to schedule your dry-run to the next available slot. For now it is expected that the actual talk date will be scheduled one week after dry-run for lightning talks, and two weeks after for featured. As we tend to inquire more time to prepare for the more complex talk.
